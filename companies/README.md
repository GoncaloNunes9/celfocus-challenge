## Running

1. Run `npm run api` to start the API (or `json-server --watch db.json`)
2. Run `npm start` to start the APP
(if they ask "to run the app on another port", just say "y" yes it will probably run on 3001)

## Routes
#### You can change port number
1. http://localhost:3001/ - Home page
2. http://localhost:3001/companies - Display all companies (same as home page)
3. http://localhost:3001/companies/:companyId - Display details of a company
4. http://localhost:3001/numbers/:numberID - Display all company contacts

Enjoy :)
